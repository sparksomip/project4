# Project 4
<h3>Wine Quality Prediction Project</h3>
<h4>📁 Field: Exploratory Data Analytics, Machine Learning using Python</h4>
<h4>📖 Topic: Predict quality of a wine using category low, medium, and high.</h4>
<h4>⚡Key words: Exploratory Data Analytics, Machine Learning</h4>

The objective of the prediction of wine quality is to improve winery's target marketing by modeling the tastes of its wine. Machine learning algorithms are explored to determine which physicochemical characteristics contribute to the quality of a wine. K-NN, Logistic Regression, Regression tree models were used.<br>
- Determine if each wine sample is red or white.<br>
- Predict the wine sample's quality(low, medium, or high).<br>
